          <p>In 2019, Wyatt changed his character to that of a friendly children's television show host who had seen the error of his previous ways. He soon debuted an evil masked alter-ego called The Fiend. During The Fiend's entrance, he carries Wyatt's severed head with a lantern inside it and uses a heavy metal cover of his old theme music performed by Code Orange.[197] He also adopted the mandible claw as a finishing move.[206]</p>
